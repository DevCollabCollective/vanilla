# vanilla

_vanilla_ is my default starting point for all front-end builds. It contains my
[inuit.css](http://inuitcss.com) as a submodule to quickly get me set up and
building on a powerful little front-end framework.

I am not precious about the code used in _vanilla_, if you want it you can have
it (but perhaps give a mention in `humans.txt`).
