# vanilla

_vanilla_ is my default starting point for all front-end builds. It contains common objects and abstractions, a comprehensive reset and other useful styles/snippets that are reused from project-to-project.

I am not precious about the code used in _vanilla_, if you want it you can have it (but perhaps give a mention in `humans.txt`).
